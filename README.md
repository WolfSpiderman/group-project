# TRICKvial MORTsuit

## Description

##  Installation

N/A, it's a webpage.

## Usage

The webpage can be found [here](https://wolfspiderman.github.io/t-rick-vial-mort-suit/).

When the user loads the page, they will only see the header of the page, and a button that looks suspiciously like some cheap knock off of one of Rick's probably trademarked portals.

The following is a screenshot of the page in the middle of the quiz:
